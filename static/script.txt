fsarah-t.png: peter-o.png: Yeah... me too..
frobert4.png: peter-o.png: What are you guys thinking… Fill me in.
frobert4.png:peter-t.png: Blackout is a genius hacker who wishes to rule the world. He sees himself as a hero, and believes that he is doing the world a favour by eliminating human error from the equation.
frobert4.png: peter-t.png : But what does a hacker like him have to do with this? It doesn't make any sense. 
#:
fsarah-t.png: peter-t.png : No it makes perfect sense. Now everything is falling into place.
fsarah-t.png:peter-o.png: Are you thinking what I am thinking? Like… don’t you remember what Dr. Jameson possessed?
fsarah-t.png:peter-o.png: Exactly! Getting Dr. Jameson’s invention would be a dream come true moment for someone like  him.
#:
fsarah-t.png:peter-o.png: With that he can create an army of machines that could be controlled remotely, and he may plan to use them to take over all the world's computer systems.
